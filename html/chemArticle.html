                It's time to pay more respect to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The chemical mostly known for
                    stripping hair of color and bad chemistry jokes has a number of features that could have
                    allowed it to give life its start, biochemists have argued.<br><br>
                “The origin of life is one of the hardest problems in all of science, but it is also one of
                    the most important,” said the Australian National University's Dr Rowena Ball in a statement.
                    Many theories, most often contradictory, have been proposed.<br><br>
                Ball has previously argued that hydrogen peroxide, as the simplest chiral molecule, i.e. one 
                    that can't be superimposed on its mirror image, could have triggered one of the more curious 
                    features of life – all nucleotides in living things have a common form.<br><br>
                In a new paper in Royal Society Open Science, Ball points out that hydrogen peroxide has other
                    features that suit it to being the spark that ignited life. For one thing, she explained to 
                    IFLScience, it is a thermochemical oscillator. When H2O2 oxidizes certain chemicals it produces
                    swings in both temperature and acidity.<br><br>
                This is very useful for life's formation because, Ball said; “The system needs to spend enough 
                    time at higher temperatures to carry out essential synthetic reactions, but not so much that 
                    the reactants are totally consumed or destroyed.” Alternative theories for life's appearance 
                    suggest temperature variations were produced externally, for example as currents swept volcanic
                    heat in changing directions. However, Ball sees the local fluctuations from hydrogen peroxide 
                    as a better fit.<br><br>
                Ball believes H2O2 worked its magic in long thin pores within rocks around hydrothermal vents, 
                    where the rock shape helped to build long polymers out of amino acids, making the chains that 
                    became RNA.<br><br>
                If life required hydrogen peroxide to appear, it would explain why it only emerged once. Although
                    some scientists hypothesize a “shadow biosphere” of life forms so different from ourselves we do
                    not recognize them as alive, all the evidence we have is that all life on Earth emerged from a 
                    single source, the question is why?<br><br>
                “Although hydrogen peroxide powered and mediated life's origins, in large quantities it is toxic
                    to cells,” Ball told IFLScience. Consequently living things created enzymes called catalases that
                    destroy H2O2, and once early life forms spread widely enough, they destroyed the molecules that
                    could have sparked a second appearance. Ball compares this to evolution burning behind it the 
                    bridge “that spanned the living and non-living molecular worlds.”<br><br>
                Ball described her theory as “highly compatible” with one published this week that proposes a major 
                    role for the chemical diamidophosphate, and hopes future work will combine them, but it contradicts
                    those that propose a role for asteroid impacts.<br><br>
